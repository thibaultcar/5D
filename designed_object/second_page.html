		<div id="bodytextaffordances"><br><br>
			Water bottles provide many affordances to the user. Primarily, they afford holding, transporting, drinking, and storing liquids. Other affordances include preventing spills, lifting and carrying, setting on a flat surface, insulating and controlling temperature, and reusing many times. 
			<br>
			<br>

</div>
		<div id="constraintstitle">Constraints</div>
		<div id="bodytextaffordances"><br><br>The physical size of the bottle must be comfortable to grasp in the hand, able to fit under a faucet, and light enough to carry yet still hold ample volume of water.
			<br>
<br>The material must be metal or stainless steel in order to be durable, malleable, nonporous, and unable to rust.
<br>
<br>Environmental consraints include that insulation is temporary and the bottle cannot keep liquid cold forever, and that the bottle must be filled with water from the environment.
<br>
<br>Water bottles also have cultural constraints pertaining to how they are usually used. In US culture, reusable water bottles are often carried around all of the time to promote healthy and eco-friendly behaviors. This communicates that the user holds sustainable values because they are choosing an alternative to wasteful disposable plastic bottles. In addition, many people decorate their water bottles with stickers to project their personal identity and aesthetic taste.</div>
