		<div id="bodytextsculpture">I envisioned a public sculpture that would make a viewer think differently about a water bottle. The location of this art installation would be the Reflecting Pool at the Christian Science Center in Boston, MA since it was designed to make the area more welcoming for visitors to sit and reflect. The proposed sculpture would be a large red upside-down water bottle hovering over the water. The water bottle would be a fountain, making it appear that water is endlessly flowing out into the pool, being wasted. The form of the tall and skinny water bottle mimics the buildings behind it, inspiring the viewer to think about how the city wastes precious resources like water. In turn, viewers can reflect on their own water usage and waste. The goal of the sculpture will be to cause viewers to see their water bottle as a prized possession that holds a valuable resource, instead of a simple everyday item. Hopefully, they will feel thankful for their water bottle.</div>
