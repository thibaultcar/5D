		<div class="aboutustext">who are you, really? what do you desire? what scares you most? what do you think about late at night? what makes you laugh? what does life mean to you? how do you know you’re in love? what wakes you up in the morning? what makes you never get out of bed? what is that one goal you are too scared to admit out loud? what would you tell your younger self?
<br><br>
bare your soul and we’ll bare ours. bare your soul to the world and the world will open itself up to you.
<br><br>
here, we hope to bring the world closer through our deepest disclosures. we like hidden secret notes addressed to the universe. with good old pen and paper, we can share our vulnerable selves and find ourselves in others. close your eyes in quiet reflection, then open them up to the faces around you, each tangled in their own complicated web of emotions, histories, and stories. take your headphones out of your ears on your walk to work and look around you, search for something hidden. be kind to each connection you might pass. take a second to learn from them.
<br><br>
if you find a note, read it. think about it. let it move and teach you. then snap a picture and upload it on this site to let the world think about it too. post your own thoughts in response, all anonymously of course. 
<br><br>
then you can watch the connections grow. and before long, we will have knit a global community of raw connections with the strangers we walk alongside everyday. 
<br><br>

go spread some love
